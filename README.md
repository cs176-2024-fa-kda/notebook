## Abstract

The transition of music consumption from offline to online realm, facilitated by technological advancements, has fundamentally transformed the music distribution landscape. In the streaming era, platforms that utilize data-driven techniques, such as tracking user behavior and analyzing audio data, have profoundly impacted on music consumption trends. As a result, technologies like recommender systems integrated into music streaming platforms contribute to bringing large, diverse audiences together, shaping a unified standard of popular music. This report presents features and patterns commonly observed among trending music based on such newfound standards. Our work particularly focuses on quantitatively examining listening trends and musical characteristics of popular music by employing exploratory data analysis on datasets founded upon the library from Spotify, spanning from 2010 to 2023. By analyzing these trends, we aim to highlight how data-driven methodologies are influencing the crowds' music preferences and consumption dynamics in the digital age.
